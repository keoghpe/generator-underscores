# generator-underscores

This is a fork of [generator-wp-underscores](https://github.com/kdo/generator-wp-underscores )
that I'm customising for my own use. Everything that's not mine is the original
authors.

A very simple [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for WordPress starter theme [_s](github.com/automattic/_s).




Run

```
grunt
```
to watch `.scss` files and live reload!

**Note:** live reload works only if you're working on localhost, 192.168.50.4, or an URL ending in .dev
